# Alerts Component

**Contributed by Chaoyang Li**

Alerts component displays a callout for user attention.

## Basic Component

### Appearance
Alerts user by message. You can define the color and the theme of Alert yourself.

import BasicAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/basic";

<BasicAlert />

### Animation
Alert component has different display modes when triggered.

import AnimationAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/animation";

<AnimationAlert />

## Variants

### With description
In some cases, Alert requires description. Description includes a message with more detailed information.

import DescriptionAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/withDescription";

<DescriptionAlert />

### With list
The detailed information of alert can also be shown as a list.

import ListAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/withList";

<ListAlert />

### With accent border

import BorderAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/withBorder";

<BorderAlert />

### With link
You can add link in the alert.

import LinkAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/withLink";

<LinkAlert />

### With dismiss button
Default alert component will be close automatically. You can also add a dismiss button, so that user can close by clicking button.

import DismissAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/withDismiss";

<DismissAlert />

### With actions
An actionable alert can help users to understand the alert and have further actions.

import ActionAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/withAction";

<ActionAlert />

## Usability

### Principle 1: Make alert banners actionable#
Whenever possible, add action button if there's a way for a user to quickly address the issue associated with an alert.

### Principle 2: Consider including a close button
The close button is optional, depending on context. Consider adding one to let a user easily dismiss the alert.

### Principle 3: Use the color appropriately
Don’t use yellow or orange colors for errors because the contrast is not accessible.
If you need to show a “notice” message or other non-critical communication, use the blue (informative) semantic color options. Reserve the red (negative) option only for errors that directly interrupt or block a user’s experience — not for nice-to-know information.

### Principle 4: Place alert banners at the top
Alert banners should appear at the top of a page.

### Principle 5: Don't stack alert banners
Don't show multiple alert banners at the same time. If a new alert appears with a higher priority message, it should replace an existing alert of lesser importance until the higher priority one has been addressed.

### Principle 6: Overlay content
Overlay an alert when it's expected to fade in and out without impacting the content underneath it, and when it's not hiding any important actions or information by being there. An alert should only overlay content if it is dismissible.

## Accessibility

### Add Sound when alert are triggered
For some visually impaired people, adding a corresponding prompt sound to ensure that the visually impaired users are aware the alerts and improve their fluency in using the webpage.

import SoundAlert from "../components/ui/alerts/soundAlert";

<SoundAlert />
