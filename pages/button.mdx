## Basic Component

<Button />

## Definition and Usage

The `<button>` tag defines a clickable button.

Inside a `<button>` element you can put text (and tags like `<i>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<br>`, `<img>`, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the `<input>` element!

Tip: Always specify the `type` attribute for a `<button>` element, to tell browsers what type of button it is.

Tip: You can easily style buttons with CSS! Look at the examples below or visit our CSS Buttons tutorial.
