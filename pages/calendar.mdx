### Highlight Today's Date

Today's date should be highlighted or differentiated from other dates.

### Visual Indicators

Important dates, events, or appointments should have distinct visual indicators.

### Responsive Design

The calendar should be usable across different devices â€“ from desktops to tablets to smartphones.

### Tooltip on Hover

Displaying additional information about a date or event when a user hovers can provide clarity.

### Drag and Drop Functionality

For advanced implementations, allowing users to drag and drop events can enhance the user experience.

### Consistent UI

Ensure that the user interface remains consistent in terms of colors, fonts, and interactions.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

Users should be able to navigate through dates and functions using just the keyboard.

### Screen Reader Support

Important elements, like dates and events, should be readable by screen readers.

### High Contrast Mode

Offer a high contrast mode for users with visual impairments.
Avoid Reliance on Color Alone: Important information should not be conveyed by color alone. Use text or symbols alongside color.
