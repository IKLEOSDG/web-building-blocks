# Calendar Component

**Contributed by Ke Louis Liu**

## Basic Calendar

<Calendar />

This is the index page for the Advanced folder!

## Accessibility

Keyboard Navigation: Users should be able to navigate through dates and functions using just the keyboard.
Screen Reader Support: Important elements, like dates and events, should be readable by screen readers.

### Input Calendar

<PureCalendar />

High Contrast Mode: Offer a high contrast mode for users with visual impairments.
Avoid Reliance on Color Alone: Important information should not be conveyed by color alone. Use text or symbols alongside color.

### Date Range Picker Calendar

<DateRangePickerCalendar />

## Usability

1. Intuitive Navigation: Users should be able to easily navigate between months and years.
2. Clear Date Selection: Clicking or tapping on a date should provide immediate visual feedback.
3. Highlight Today's Date: Today's date should be highlighted or differentiated from other dates.
4. Visual Indicators: Important dates, events, or appointments should have distinct visual indicators.
5. Responsive Design: The calendar should be usable across different devices â€“ from desktops to tablets to smartphones.
6. Tooltip on Hover: Displaying additional information about a date or event when a user hovers can provide clarity.
7. Drag and Drop Functionality: For advanced implementations, allowing users to drag and drop events can enhance the user experience.
8. Consistent UI: Ensure that the user interface remains consistent in terms of colors, fonts, and interactions.
