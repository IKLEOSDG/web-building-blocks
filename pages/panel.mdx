## Accessibility
<details>
<summary>**Writing appropriate markup for panel**</summary>
If the panel doesn't contain an accurate WAI-ARIA role or property, the screen reader software won't recognize the purpose of the message â€” and neither will the user.  
Thus, a ARIA role is needed for the accessibility of panel. `role="alert"`should be used in this case for important information that needs to be presented to the user immediately.
