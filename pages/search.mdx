# Input Basic Components

This is the index page for the Advanced folder!

## Text Input Component

This is the most basic input component.

<TextInputComponent />


# Usability

## Clear hint and label to remind user 

Provide label and placeholder for the user to know what to type in the input box. Placeholder is the word that is within the input box.

<HintLabel />

{/* {React.createElement(HintLabel)} */}

## Autocomplete and suggestions

Provide suggestions for user input, so that users have a better experience and reduce the occurrence of input errors. If we define autoComplete as email, browser will help us to complete the following words if we enter them before.

<AutoComplete />

{/* {React.createElement(TextInputWithLabel)} */}

## Appropriate input type
Give the input the correct type. For example, if it is date input, the type should be date. We cannot let the user type in their birthday but the type we assigned is email.

<InputType />

{/*{React.createElement(AppropriateType)} */}

## Required input 
Set the input to be required can prevent users not making mistakes and let them know which inputs are required and which are not required.

<RequiredInput />

{/*{React.createElement(RequiredInput)}*/}

# Accessibility

## Avoid Caps Labels 
You should never use all caps, or else the labels would be difficult to read and much harder to quickly scan, as there are no differences in character height any more.UPPERCASE text is harder to read because the shapes of all the uppercase letters are all rectangular and users are not used to reading text that way.

## Font Size
Your fonts have to be big enough to be legible. A safe bet is to use 16 pixels for body copy. The sizing of course depends on the context and how many other things are on the page, but when in doubt, try to make things bigger.

## Label Color
The label’s color should reflect your app’s color palette, while also meeting appropriate contrast ratios (shouldn’t be too bright or too dark). The W3C recommends the following contrast ratios for body text:

．Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.

．Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background.
