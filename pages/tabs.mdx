# Tabs Component

**Contributed by Yitong He**

Tabs organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them. The content under the set of tabs should be related and form a coherent unit.

import Tabs from "../components/ui/tabs";

<Tabs />

## Usability
- **Use tabs to alternate between views within the same context,** not to navigate to different areas. This is the single most important point, because staying in place while alternating views is the reason we have tabs in the first place.
- Use tabs only when users **don't need to see content from multiple tabs simultaneously.** If people do need to compare the info behind different tabs, then having to switch back and forth puts an added burden on their short-term memory, increases cognitive load and interaction cost, and lowers usability compared to a design that puts everything on one big page.
- **Highlight the currently selected tab.** Make sure that the highlighting is prominent enough so people can tell which tab is selected.
- **The unselected tabs should be clearly visible and readable,** reminding the user of the additional options. If the nonhighlighted tabs are faded too much into the background, there's a risk that users will never click them and never discover the many hidden features.
- Stick to only **one row** of tabs. Multiple rows create jumping UI elements, which destroy spatial memory and thus make it impossible for users to remember which tabs they've already visited. Also, multiple rows are a sure symptom of excessive complexity: If you need more tabs than will fit in a single row, you must simplify your design.
- Place the row of tabs **on top** of the tab panel — not on the sides or the bottom, where users often overlook them.

## Accessibility
- While an aria-label is not explicitly required for a tab list, **Tabs should be labeled using a aria-label in the absence of an ancestor landmark.** This will prevent screen readers from announcing non-focused tabs, allowing for a more focused experience.

- Some accessibility labels require more descriptive text, particularly when the visible UI is ambiguous or not visible. For example, an icon button visually represents a “video camera,” requires additional information in its accessibility label to clarify the icon’s intent.

- The key to making tabs accessible is to toggle CSS display properties and some ARIA states on user click or focus events (e.g. toggle aria-selected, tabindex, and display:none/block; and/or aria-hidden='true/false').
