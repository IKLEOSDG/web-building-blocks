# Toast Component

**Contributed by Ke Louis Liu**

## Basic Component

<Toast />

## Definition and Usage

Toasts display brief, temporary notifications. They're meant to be noticed without disrupting a user's experience or requiring an action to be taken.

## Variants

### Toast with Title

<TitleToast />

### Toast with Action

<ActionToast />

## Usability

### Toast or dialog?

Toasts should only be used for confirmations, simple notifications, and low-priority alerts that do not need to completely interrupt the user experience.

Dialogs are ideal for when a situation requires a user’s attention, either for displaying important information or prompting for a response.

### Placement

Toast position differs depending on platform scale. By default, a toast is placed at the bottom end for desktop scale and at the bottom center for mobile scale, to avoid disrupting the user experience.

For desktop applications, a toast should be placed 16 px away from the bottom and to the right of the viewport.

For mobile applications, a toast should be placed at the bottom center, 16 px above the bottom toolbar. In smaller viewports, a toast is never larger than the viewport width (with 8 px left and right margins).

If a toast isn’t noticeable or doesn't disrupt the user experience, its placement can be changed to bottom center, bottom end, top end, or top center.

### Don’t place mobile toasts over navigation

On mobile apps, be mindful of important navigation bars at the bottom of the screen by placing toasts vertically above these components.

### Don’t display more than one action

Actionable toasts should only have one button, in the form of a static white, secondary outline button.

### Don't include a redundant action

Actionable toasts should not have a button with a redundant action. For example, including a “Dismiss” button would be redundant because all toasts already have a close button.

### Multiple toasts

Don't show multiple toasts at the same time. When toasts are consecutively or simultaneously triggered, their display and behavior should follow a priority queue.

### Too many toasts

Be mindful of how often you trigger toasts. Even though they're not as disruptive as dialogs, they still interrupt a user’s attention. Frequent interruptions interfere with usability, especially for people with visual and cognitive disabilities (see WCAG Success Criterion 2.2.4 Interruptions).

Products should allow for users to be able turn off all types of alerts. Doing this helps people who want to focus and minimize information that they may find non-essential.

## Accessibility

### Contrast

The text and background colors of toasts should have sufficient contrast to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

### Screen Readers

oast content should be accessible to screen readers, announcing the message audibly for users with visual disabilities.

### Keyboard Navigation

If a toast includes interactive elements, such as buttons, they should be navigable and usable with a keyboard.

### Dismissal

Provide an option for users to manually dismiss the toast, ensuring it doesn't become a persistent distraction, especially for users with cognitive disabilities.
